**World-Population-Analysis-Dataset**

**Description of dataset**

This population dataset containing global population statistics such as total population, land area, density, fertility rate, urban population, and world percentage per country for the year 2023.

**Dataset Description and Its Role in Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning**

This dataset provides a structured summary of global population statistics for various countries and regions as of the year 2023. Each row in the dataset corresponds to a country or territory and contains information such as total population, yearly population change (percentage), population density per square kilometer, total land area, net migration figures, fertility rate, median age of the population, and the percentage of the population living in urban areas. These attributes offer a rich overview of demographic trends and socioeconomic conditions across the globe. One particularly insightful metric that may be included is the "World Population Percentage", which indicates each country’s share of the total global population. If this column is present, it can serve as a dependent variable in supervised learning tasks—such as predicting a country’s global population share based on other demographic features.

However, if the "World Population Percentage" is not included, the dataset lacks a predefined target variable, making it more suitable for unsupervised learning. In this scenario, machine learning techniques like clustering (e.g., K-Means) can be applied to group countries based on similar population characteristics—such as fertility rate, urbanization, and migration patterns—without trying to predict a specific output. This allows for the discovery of hidden patterns, regional groupings, or anomalies within the data. Therefore, the presence or absence of the "World Percentage" column fundamentally influences whether the dataset is used for supervised prediction or unsupervised exploration.
